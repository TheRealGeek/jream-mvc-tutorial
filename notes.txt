Libs dir contain the class definitions

'controllers' Directory 
    Contains the controllers (similar to routers in JS, from what I understand ) for each one.
    Each of these files contains a specific class for each file, which extends the 'Controller' class  
        ie. class Index from controllers/index.php extends class Controller from libs/class.controller.php
    The new class CLASSNAME inside the controllers/PAGENAME.php then tells the controller class to use the View class from libs/class.view.php, which in turn routes the program to look in the View directory for a file called views/URLNAME.php and render that.
Views directory
    Contains what the file is rendering. 
    In this particular project, the way we have it all routed, the View class renders 3 files by default: 
        /views/header.php
        /views/PAGENAME/index.php
        /views/footer.php
    In the order listed above. The middle file is where the value of the <div id="content"></div> exists, and where the bulk of the page content comes from. 
        In the header.php file, it automatically loads the styling from views/public/css/default.css, which in turn applies it to each that uses the header.php file by default. 
Models should be the only place that the database is being accessed
