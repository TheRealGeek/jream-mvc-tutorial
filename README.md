# jream-mvc-tutorial
Following along with JREAM's PHP MVC tutorial https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7A20112CF84B2229
The first branch are parts 1 and 2 of the tutorial. 
After that, each branch will contain a specific part of the tutorial

I did the tutorial on a mac using MAMP. The files should be loaded into /Applications/MAMP/htdocs 
You can create a parent directory to contain all of the files within the htdocs directory, but you will have to rememeber to either change the default load location for MAMP, or ensure that the path is reflected in your address bar ie: "http://localhost:PORTNAME/DIRECTORYNAME"

Finished Part 3
